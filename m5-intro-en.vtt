Hello and welcome to Module 5.

00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:09,125
In this module, we're going to go back to HTML.

00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,630
This time, we will combine it with CSS to learn

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,725
some advanced features and design more complex Web pages.

00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,600
We will be using all the knowledge and

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,540
skills we have learned over the past four modules.

00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,355
We will learn about Colors,

00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:27,270
Fonts, Selectors, and Pseudo Elements.

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,190
We will also be looking at how to

00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,440
use Multimedia in our Web page.

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,070
And even try our hands at some simple Animations.

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,980
As always, I wish you a great learning time this week.
