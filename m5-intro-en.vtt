Hello Miguel and welcome to Module 5.

1
00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.125
In this module, we're going to go back to HTML.

2
00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.630
This time, we will combine it with CSS to learn

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.725
some advanced features and design more complex Web pages.

4
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.600
We will be using all the knowledge and

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.540
skills we have learned over the past four modules.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.355
We will learn about Colors,

7
00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.270
Fonts, Selectors, and Pseudo Elements.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.190
We will also be looking at how to

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.440
use Multimedia in our Web page.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.070
And even try our hands at some simple Animations.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.980
As always, I wish you a great learning time this week.
